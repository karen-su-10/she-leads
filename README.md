# SheLeads

This project was built for the She Builds AI hackathon. 

# Project Goal and Description
This AI powered solution is aim to promote women and girl’s Economic Equality and Leadership.

On the journey of growth, if we could see the paths ahead of us in advance, or become aware of paths we didn't know existed, 
we could eliminate our blind spots.
Knowing how exceptional women predecessors have navigated their professional journeys 
step by step—how many years they spent, how many fields they worked in,
and how much experience they amassed—would provide us with numerous references. 
This knowledge shows us where to go and what information to seek, 
revealing the different possibilities in other fields, continents, and countries.
Thus, we can relate these insights to our own reality and understand what we ourselves can do. 

On this SheLeads website, I start with this year's Fortune magazine's 'Most Powerful Women in Business 2024,' featuring the top 100 women in the business world. 
I provide a map of outstanding women for females of different ages and countries. 
Click on an industry you wish to explore to get a list of the world's leading women in that field. 
Click on the name you want to know more about to open a summary of her company and her career path.
At the end of the resume generated by Gemini, there's a feature to chat with Gemini, where you can ask questions about her in more detail. 
Are there any recommended autobiographies of her? What other well-known companies are there in her field? 
The conversation can extend indefinitely.


## How Google Gemini is used in this project
Google Gemini is used to generate all contents of each individual's profile, including the company summarize  and the individual's career path summarize.
A chatbot is also implemented to enable user to ask more details about the company and individual.
